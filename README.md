Step 1: Title and Introduction
Title: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) Data Analysis and Anomaly Detection

Content: This project involves analyzing Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data for signal analysis, line detection, and anomaly detection. Python, Pandas, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn were utilized for the analysis.
Step 2: What is Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)?
Content: DAS is a technology where optical fiber cables are used to detect acoustic signals along the length of a pipeline. The fiber cable is placed around the pipeline and monitors fluid flow inside.
Graphic: Add a diagram or image explaining how the optical fiber is placed around the pipeline.
Step 3: Dataset Overview and Initial Analysis
Content:
The rows in the DAS data correspond to depths, and the columns correspond to minutes.
Initial statistical summary and visualizations were performed to understand the data structure.
Code: Display the result of data.describe() for an overview of the dataset.
Step 4: Heatmap Visualization
Content: A spatiotemporal heatmap was created to visualize the variation in signal strength over time and depth.
Graphic: Display the spatiotemporal heatmap.
The heatmap shows how signal strength changes across depth and time.
Code: Include the code and the resulting heatmap.
Step 5: Signal Change at Selected Depths
Content: The signal variation over time at specific depths (100m, 500m, and 1000m) was plotted to observe patterns.
Graphic: A line plot showing the signal over time at selected depths.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
selected_depths = [100, 500, 1000]
for depth in selected_depths:
    plt.plot(data.iloc[depth], label=f'Depth {depth}m')
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6: Edge Detection
Content: Edge detection was applied to the data using the Canny edge detection method to highlight significant edges in the signal.
Graphic: Display the result of Canny edge detection with the detected lines.
Code: Canny edge detection and Hough Line Transform code with the resulting image.
Step 7: Line Detection with DBSCAN
Content: After detecting edges with Canny, the DBSCAN algorithm was applied to detect lines via clustering.
Graphic: A scatter plot with the detected lines using DBSCAN, color-coded by clusters.
Code: Show the DBSCAN algorithm used to detect lines.
Step 8: Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest
Content: The Isolation Forest algorithm was used to detect anomalies in the DAS data. A contamination rate of 1% was used to detect unusual signal behavior.
Graphic: A visualization showing the detected anomalies.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01, random_state=42)
clf.fit(data)
anomalies_ml = clf.predict(data)
data['Anomaly'] = anomalies_ml
anomalies_detected = data[data['Anomaly'] == -1]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 9: Results and Conclusion
Content:
The results of the signal analysis, edge detection, and anomaly detection were presented.
The detected lines indicate significant changes in the signal.
Anomaly detection highlighted unexpected behavior at certain depths.
Conclusion: These analyses can help monitor pipeline conditions and detect potential problems early.
